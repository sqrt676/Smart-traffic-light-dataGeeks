Improvement 2 : give the priority to large vehicles 

# Functionality of this version
This version allows to give the priority to large vehicles in order to manage emergency, decrease pollution and traffic jams. Indeed, emergency vehicles (ambulances, fire engines,...) have to pass quickly, and large vehicles (trucks,...) cause more traffic jams and pollution when it is stopped. 


# Further informations
Code modified in order to:

- Use rectangles instead of circles to frame vehicles to calculate an accurate area
- Turn light to green if area is bigger than a threshold
