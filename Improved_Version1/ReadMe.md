# Functionality of this version

This version allows to detect automatically the road limits with calibration objects. In other words, our system is adapted to all sizes of road of cross crossroads. 

# Further informations

Calibration objects are put on the limits of the crossroads

Code modified in order to:

- deduce crossroads limits

Cars crossing the crossroads (so inside it and not on the roads anymore) and outside the roads are not taken into account.
