My feedback regarding :

- Work done : 
The tutorial version is working correctly after some modifications made by us. 
Moreover, two improvements were added : the automatic calibration of roads, and the detection of priority vehicles. 
  
- Difficulties : 
Lots of connections (welding)
Time was short

 
- Tutorial original quality and working tutorial : 
Original code was only working with PiCamera and detection was not very accurate. 
Original code was working specifically for his structure (if roads are disposed differently, this code does not work anymore). 

- Added Value :
Project working with any USB webcam camera
Detection of cars more accurate
Automatic calibration of roads
Detection of priority vehicles
